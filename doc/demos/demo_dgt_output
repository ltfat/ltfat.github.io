------ Spectrogram analysis -----------------------------------
 
The spectrogram is highly redundant.
No. of coefficients in the signal:       400
No. of coefficients in the spectrogram:  80400
Redundacy of the spectrogram:            201.000000
 
---- Simple Gabor analysis using a standard Gaussian window. ----
Setup parameters for a Discrete Gabor Transform.
Time shift:
a =  20
Number of frequency channels.
M =  40
 
Note that it must hold that L = M*b = N*a for some integers b, N and L,
and that a<M. L is the transform length, and the DGT will choose the
smallest possible value of L that is larger or equal to the length of the
signal. Choosing a<M makes the transform redundant, otherwise the
transform will be lossy, and reconstruction will not be possible.
Number of time shifts in transform:
Length of transform:
L =  400
 
The redundancy of the Gabor transform can be reduced without loosing information.
No. of coefficients in the signal:       400
No. of output coefficients from the DGT: 800
Redundacy of the DGT (in this case)      2.000000
 
---- Real valued Gabor analysis. ----
 
---- Perfect reconstruction. ----
