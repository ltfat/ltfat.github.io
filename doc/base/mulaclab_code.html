<span class="c">%   Usage: mulaclab;</span>
<span class="c">% </span>
<span class="c">%   When starting the interface, the user is asked to choose the processed</span>
<span class="c">%   signal, named original signal in the interface.  Possible signals are</span>
<span class="c">%   .wav files and .mat files containing decompositions preliminarily</span>
<span class="c">%   saved using the MULACLAB interface.  The interface only handles</span>
<span class="c">%   monochannel signals. So for a multichannel .wav files, the first channel</span>
<span class="c">%   is used as the original signal.</span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%   After choosing the original signal, the user is presented with the main</span>
<span class="c">%   interface. This interface is divided in two areas: </span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%    The right part of the figure contains the visualizations, which</span>
<span class="c">%     represent the spectrograms of the original and modified signals.</span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%     The &#39;Original signal&#39; visualization is used to display the original</span>
<span class="c">%     signal spectrogram and to graphically define the symbol of the Gabor </span>
<span class="c">%     multiplier that will be applied on this signal. </span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%     The &#39;Overview of original signal&#39; visualization also represents the</span>
<span class="c">%     original signal spectrogram and can be used for fast zooming and moving</span>
<span class="c">%     of the other visualizations. Zooming and moving is controlled by mouse</span>
<span class="c">%     interaction with the white rectangle displayed on this visualization. </span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%     The &#39;Modified signal&#39; visualization is used to display the spectrogram</span>
<span class="c">%     of the modified signal after application of the multiplier.</span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%     It is possible to hide the &#39;Overview of original signal&#39; and &#39;Modified</span>
<span class="c">%     signal&#39; visulizations using the &#39;Visualization&#39; menu.</span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%    The left part of the figure contains panels with tools for user </span>
<span class="c">%     interaction.</span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%     The &#39;Audioplayer&#39; panel contains the controls for audio playback of the</span>
<span class="c">%     original and modified signal.</span>

<span class="c">%     The &#39;Visualization&#39; panel contains tools used to adapt the display</span>
<span class="c">%     of the visualizations.</span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%     The &#39;Selection&#39; panel contains tools and information concerning the</span>
<span class="c">%     multilayered selection used to graphically specify the symbol of the </span>
<span class="c">%     multiplier.</span>
<span class="c">% </span>
<span class="c">%   Known Matlab limitations: </span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%    When using Matlab on Linux with multiple screens, there might be a </span>
<span class="c">%     Matlab bug preventing the display of the multiplier symbol. This can be</span>
<span class="c">%     solved by docking the figure.</span>
<span class="c">%</span>
<span class="c">%    When using a Matlab version prior to 7.3 (R2006b), the rectangle</span>
<span class="c">%     displayed on the &#39;Overview of original signal&#39; visualization is not</span>
<span class="c">%     automatically updated when using the zoom and pan tools of the &#39;Zoom&#39; </span>
<span class="c">%     panel. It can be manually updated by re-clicking on the currently</span>

<span class="c">% questions : do we want to :</span>
<span class="c">% - have the possibility to use Gaussian window? (any window?) - check</span>
<span class="c">% - be able to export the symbol? </span>
<span class="c">% - be able to export the coeff? </span>
<span class="c">% - automatically generate a matlab file applying the corresponding gabor</span>

<span class="c">% selection I will have a level which is too low, when everything works</span>
<span class="c">% nicely with a slightly modified version of the selection.</span>

<span class="c">% - possibility to have a nice view (3D?) of the mask</span>
<span class="c">% - possibility to choose the channel and a time selection of wave</span>
<span class="c">% - switch between original and modified when playing</span>
<span class="c">% - add editable keyboard shortcuts for almost everything</span>
<span class="c">% - comment the functions</span>
<span class="c">% - add a simple polygon simplification function (at least for straight </span>
<span class="c">% line with magic wand)</span>
<span class="c">% - for changing mouse pointer, see what can be done using </span>
<span class="c">%   iptPointerManager</span>
<span class="c">% - give possibility to use a Gaussian window</span>

<span class="c">% - precise problems if public distribution of this file (use of </span>
<span class="c">%   PolygonClip and icons)</span>
<span class="c">% - update information of contextual menu for layers to know what are the</span>
