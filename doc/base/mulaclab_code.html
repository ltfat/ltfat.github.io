<span class="c">%           In Octave, uses bwfill which is written in c++</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="c">% Mulaclab was initially developped only for MATLAB as Octave was at that time</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">% missing the needed features to build advanced GUIs.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">%</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">% In this original version, nested functions were used to share data among GUI</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">% callbacks and a set of variables where defined at the top level of the</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">% mulaclab function to share the data between the GUI components.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">%</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">% With its version 4.0.0, Octave gained most of the GUI features needed by</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">% mulaclab, so mulaclab was then adapted to work on both MATLAB and Octave.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">%</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">% But Octave 4.0.0 doesn&#39;t support the use of nested functions in GUI callbacks.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">% So the new version of mulaclab now uses global variables to share data</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c">% among GUI callbacks (even if it&#39;s not an elegant solution, but we do with the</span><span class="w"></span>
